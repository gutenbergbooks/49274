<p>The medals described in this Guide have been selected for their
historical interest from the larger series in the Medal Room, and are
exhibited in the Cases marked E, F, G, H. The specimens in gold
are represented by electrotypes, and those in lead by plaster casts,
coloured so as to resemble the originals. Each medal is separately
labelled and numbered, the numbers referring to the descriptions in
the Guide.</p>

<p>The Introduction gives as much information as could be admitted
in the limits, and each medal is described and explained on the same
principle. The metal is also stated, and the sizes in inches and
tenths, with other particulars necessary for identification.</p>

<p>The first illustrated edition of this work being exhausted, a second
is now issued, with a new set of eight plates, executed by the Autotype
Process from casts in plaster.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Arrangement.</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Medals</span> serve for two purposes, for the illustration of
history and as records of the contemporary state of art.
Some series, like that of Italy, have more interest for their
artistic merit than their historical import. This may also
be said in a great degree of the French medals; but in
the English and Dutch series the interest lies rather
in the historical value than in the artistic qualities,
the medallic art of neither country attaining at any time
any high degree of excellence. The medals which are
described in this Guide, although to some extent examples
of contemporary art, must therefore be considered
interesting chiefly as records and illustrations of the
history of England for a period of over three hundred
years. For this reason a classification of the medals by
artists has not been attempted, and a simple chronological
order has been preferred. This, however, has been
relaxed in a few instances, as in that of the personal
medals, which for the most part are placed at the end
of the reign in which the persons portrayed flourished;
and in a few cases where it has been considered advisable
to class together the medals of a particular artist, in order
that the merit of his work could be better studied and
compared. This has been done in the case of the medals
by Stephen of Holland, Simon Passe, and some of those
by Thomas and Abraham Simon. The military and naval
decorations form a separate series, and are therefore
described at the end of the Guide; by this means making
the arrangement more useful to those who take special
interest in this particular branch. A small selection
could, however, only be made from the series in the
Museum collection, on account of the limited space for
exhibition. In many cases where English medals fail to
illustrate important events, selections have been made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
from the Dutch and other series in order to render the
historical record as complete as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Historical
Series.</span></div>

<p>With very few exceptions, there are no medals of
interest in the English series dating before the reign
of Henry VIII.  During the fifteenth century a few
counters were struck, which directly or indirectly refer to
events in English history; but these are for the most part
of French work, and the medal which is placed first in this
Guide, although bearing the portrait of an Englishman,
John Kendal, is undoubtedly of Italian work, and was
probably executed at Venice. The Dassier series of the
early sovereigns, being a production of the last century,
cannot be said to have a place in the early medallic records
of this country, and is not included in this exhibition.
The series of English medals may therefore be said to
commence with the reign of Henry VIII., of which period,
besides a number of interesting jetons and medalets, there
are some well-executed medals of the King himself, such
as No. <a href="#M3">3</a>, his portrait evidently after a painting by Holbein,
another recording his supremacy over the Church (Nos.
<a href="#M4">4</a>—5), and several remarkable badges. There are also other
medals, chiefly personal, which bear the portraits of Sir
Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell Earl of Essex, Anne
Boleyn, and Michael Mercator, himself a medallist as well
as a diplomatist. The short reign of Edward VI. gives
but few examples, of which two are exhibited, one bearing
only a portrait of the king, which appears to be a cast in
lead from a silver plate; and the other, his coronation
medal, the type of which was taken from the "Head of
the Church" medal of Henry VIII.  The only other
interesting works of this reign are the Christ's Hospital
badges and medalets, the School having been founded
by Edward in 1553. Of Mary there is also little worthy
of note beyond some excellent portraits of herself and
Philip, and a medal which refers to the condition of
England during her reign.  These were executed by
Trezzo at Madrid, and are the first signed medals of the
English series. The illness of Elizabeth in 1572, her
struggle with the Papal party, as well as her acceptance
of the protection of the Netherlands, and the defeat
and destruction of the Spanish Armada, afforded subjects
for commemoration. The medals relating to the destruction
of the Armada are certainly among the finest pieces
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
ever produced in England, and are good examples of the
art of the time. The period of Elizabeth ends with a series
of medallic portraits by Stephen of Holland, most of
which bear the date 1562, and all apparently executed
about that year.</p>

<p>The undisputed accession of the House of Stuart to the
English throne and the peaceable reign of its first king
limit the subjects for medallic illustration. The medals of
the reign of James are purely personal, with few exceptions,
such as the Gunpowder Plot (No. <a href="#M45">45</a>), and the alliance
between England, France, and the United Provinces, for
the protection of the latter against the power of Spain
(Nos. <a href="#M46">46</a>—47). The rest present us with several portraits
of the King and of various members of the royal family,
and of leading personages, of whom are the Marquis
(afterwards Duke) of Buckingham, Richard Sackville
Earl of Dorset, Sir Thomas Bodley, founder of the public
library at Oxford, and others. There is also a series of
royal badges, a species of memorial which becomes much
more general in the next reign. These are followed by
a selection of engraved portraits of royal personages and
others by Simon Passe, who excelled in this style of work.</p>

<p>There are no medals which indicate the early contest
between Charles I. and the Parliament, those which are
issued before 1640 referring for the most part to the
royal family and to eminent persons, with the exception
of the Scottish coronation medals of 1633 and those
commemorating the settlement of the Dutch Fishery
question in 1636. After the Declaration of Parliament
in 1642, when the country was divided into two parties,
a new era in its medallic history begins, and medals are
struck in extraordinary numbers. This continues during
the period of the Civil War, and, besides medals which
record the successes of both parties, there is a large number
of Royalist and Parliamentarian badges, with portraits of
the generals and statesmen on both sides. Fortunately,
England at this time produced several artists, whose works
are fitted to take the first rank in the national series.
These artists were Thomas and Abraham Simon, who
worked for the Parliament, and Thomas Rawlins, who was
in the service of the King. The series of this reign ends
with several examples of the badges worn by those who
sympathised with the royal cause and with a few medals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
recording the King's death. With the period of the
Commonwealth the issue of royalist badges ceases, and for
the next ten years the medals are of the parliamentarian
class. These consist of portrait medals of the Protector,
of his family, and of the leading statesmen and generals,
and also of military and naval rewards, for the most part
executed by the two Simons. The Dunbar medal (Nos.
<a href="#M149">149</a>—150), which was issued for distribution among those
engaged in that battle, is the first authorized military
decoration known. It was struck by order of the Parliament
immediately after the engagement. Naval medals
were also issued on several occasions, the most important
being those for Blake's victories over the Dutch in 1653
(Nos. <a href="#M155">155</a>—158). The Commonwealth series closes with
several medals, English and Dutch, commemorating the
death of the Protector, and also with a few personal
medals, chiefly by the Simons.</p>

<p>The Restoration of Charles II. was an occasion not to be
passed by unnoticed by medallists, and of no event are there
more medals, except perhaps of the accession of William III.
and Mary. Some anticipate the restoration of the King,
and others trace step by step his return from Holland,
his landing at Dover, the joy expressed by the people
at his return, and his coronation at Westminster. The
unpopular cession of Dunkirk is only recorded on medals
issued in France by Louis XIV. or on Dutch satirical
medalets; but the well-contested engagements of the subsequent
struggle between England and Holland for the
dominion of the sea, and the close of the war by the Peace
of Breda, are numerously illustrated. Those which refer
to the Peace of Breda were for the most part executed in
Holland, and are remarkable examples of the Dutch
medallic style of that time. Of the next war with Holland
from 1672—1674, there are no English medals, and those
relating to it which are exhibited are French and Dutch.
The alarm created by the growing strength of the Catholic
party and the discovery of the pretended Popish Plot, with
the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey and also the Rye
House Plot, form the subjects of the next group of medals
(Nos. <a href="#M233">233</a>—238, <a href="#M240">240</a>). Of those of the 'Popish Plot' there is
a remarkable medal, which appears to be Dutch, and which
gives in detail the supposed circumstances connected with
the murder of Godfrey. Many of the portraits of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
illustrious men who flourished during this reign are the
work of the two Simons, and were mostly executed soon
after the Restoration. The important events of the short
reign of James II. give much scope to engravers. Medals
are shown recording the rebellion of Monmouth and
Argyll and its suppression, the attempt of James to re-establish
the Roman Catholic religion by the repeal of
the Test Act, the imprisonment of the Seven Bishops,
and lastly the invitation to William of Orange, with the
abdication and flight of James, his queen and son. On
these latter medals frequent allusions are made to the supposed
illegitimacy of the young Prince. The series of
plots and rebellions which followed the flight of James
are for the most part recorded by medals struck by the
Stuarts abroad (Nos. <a href="#M292">292</a>—319): these were issued for
distribution among those who sympathised with the exiled
house. The medals which bear the portraits of James II.
and his son are supposed to have been presented to those
who visited them in their exile. No. <a href="#M311">311</a>, on which the
rule of the House of Hanover is satirized, is one of the
medals struck for the purpose of rousing the adherents of
the House of Stuart into action; whilst No. <a href="#M315">315</a> refers to
the rebellion of 1745, and the next medal to the secret
visit of the Younger Pretender to London in 1752, when
he was again planning an invasion. The series ends with
a medal setting forth the claims of Henry Duke of York
as Henry IX. to the throne of his grandfather.</p>

<p>With the Stuart family are specially connected the
medalets which are called touch-pieces (Nos. <a href="#M320">320</a>—324).
The custom of touching by the sovereigns of this country
for the cure of scrofula or 'the King's evil' appears to
have existed since the reign of Edward the Confessor. At
first the practice was rare, but in course of time it increased
to such an extent that it is said Elizabeth's 'healings,'
which were at first monthly, became of daily occurrence, and
many thousands were touched. The power was not claimed
by Cromwell; but at the Restoration it was revived, and
Charles touched during his reign over 90,000 applicants.
It was also much practised by James II., but repudiated by
William III. It was again revived by Anne, who was the
latest sovereign to perform the ceremony, and among the last
of those whom she touched was the afterwards celebrated
Dr. Johnson. The Elder Pretender claimed the power, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
so did his sons Charles and Henry, the former having
exercised it in the name of his father at Edinburgh
during the rebellion of 1745. It was during the reign
of Henry VII. that the presentation to each applicant of
a small piece of gold attached to a band of white
ribbon was first generally introduced. The angel was the
piece given, partly because it was the smallest gold coin
struck and partly on account of a certain fitness of type
and inscription, having on one side the archangel Michael
overcoming the dragon, and on the other side a ship in
the sea and the inscription 'Per crucem tuam salva nos
Christe Redemptor.' The coin remained of the same type
during the reigns of Elizabeth, James I., and Charles I.;
but the inscription in each case was changed. At the
Restoration, when the angel was no longer issued as a
current coin, Charles II. ordered medalets of similar type
to be struck, bearing the inscription 'Soli Deo gloria.' On
account of the attendance at the 'healings' having so largely
increased, these medalets are much less in weight and size
than the angel. James II. was the first king to strike the
medalets in silver as well as in gold; which were scarcely
half the size of Charles II.'s. The Elder Pretender as
James III. also struck them in gold and silver. There are
no pieces known of Charles Edward; but of his brother
the Cardinal, as Henry IX. there are specimens in silver.
The medalet given by Anne is of gold and somewhat larger
than that of James II.</p>

<p>The medals of William and Mary and of Anne are the
most numerous and historically the most complete of the
English series. This may be attributed to the stirring
events due to the connection of the interests of England
and Holland and to the number of active medallists of
Holland and Germany.</p>

<p>The journey of William to England, his landing at Torbay,
his subsequent coronation and the flight of James, are
illustrated by a number of medals of which interesting
examples are described in this Guide. The rebellion in
Ireland, with the battles of the Boyne and of Aghrim,
and the capture of towns, next follow. The events of
the war with France, concluded in 1697 by the Peace of
Ryswick, produced medals, English, Dutch, and French,
recording the naval battle of La Hogue, the taking of
Namur by the French and the retaking of that city by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
William, the defeats of William at Steinkirk and Landen,
for which his own countrymen held him up to ridicule
(No. <a href="#M390">390</a>), the unsuccessful attempt on Brest, the bombardment
of Havre and Dunkirk, and the taking of Huy.
The other events commemorated by the medals are the
passing of the Toleration Act in 1689, the regency of Mary,
the return of William to Holland, the death of Mary, the
Darien expedition, and lastly the death of William.</p>

<p>The War of the Spanish Succession, which had begun
shortly before the death of William, was even more fruitful
in medals than the previous conflict with France. For
the events of the campaigns of the Duke of Marlborough
and of Prince Eugene of Savoy in the Netherlands and
Germany, and of that in Spain, as well as for the naval
victories, the reader must be referred to the descriptions
given at pp. 89—104. A few other events, which happened
during the reign of Anne and to which medals
refer, are the establishment of the Queen Anne's Bounty,
the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, the attempted
invasion of Scotland by the Elder Pretender in 1708, and
the trial of Sacheverell.</p>

<p>With the accession of the House of Hanover the medallic
series of England loses much of its interest. The affairs
of England and Holland being no longer so closely united,
the Dutch artists ceased to execute medals for England,
and at that time there were few medallists in this country.
The series therefore from this period is far less complete
and of very inferior style and work. The only important
events recorded by the medals of George I. are the Jacobite
rebellion in Scotland in 1715, the war of the Quadruple
Alliance, and the siege of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The first ten years of George II. are also devoid of
medallic interest, and it is not until the outbreak of the
war of the Austrian Succession that we have a piece of
any merit. The best medals of this period are those of the
battle of Dettingen executed by Haesling and of the battle
of Minden by Holtzhey, a native of Amsterdam. Other
recorded events of this reign are the taking of Porto
Bello and the attempt on Carthagena by Admiral Vernon
(of these events there are more than a hundred different
medalets), and the Jacobite rebellion under the Younger
Pretender, 1745—6. There is also a series of medals issued
by the Society for the Promotion of Arts and Commerce,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
commemorating the conquest of Canada and the successes
of the forces of England in India. In portrait-medals the
most important are the works of Dassier, of whom
mention has already been made.</p>

<p>The medals which illustrate the long reign of George
III. down to the battle of Waterloo in 1815, at which
point this exhibition closes, will be found to record all
that is of importance during that period. The events are
so numerous and varied that the reader must be referred
to the descriptions, which will be found at pp. 113—130.
The greater portion of the medals relate to the struggle
of England with her American colonists, and to the subsequent
wars with France, Spain, and Holland, by sea and
land. Following these are several pieces commemorating
some of the battles of the Peninsular War, and bearing
portraits of the principal generals, and a few personal
medals of statesmen and others, among whom may be
noted Washington and Benjamin Franklin. The series of
historical medals closes with one of the finest productions
of the art of modern times, the Waterloo medal, designed
and executed by Pistrucci, a work of 'surpassing size and
beauty,' on which the artist spent a great portion of his life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Military
and Naval
Medals.</span></div>

<p>The selection of military and naval medals commences
with that struck for the battle of Culloden, those which
were issued before that period being included in the
general series. The earliest pieces which belong to this
class are probably the Armada medals; their variety,
their oval form, as well as the circumstance that most
have rings for suspension, and some have still chains
attached to them, leaving little doubt but that they were
intended as decorations. There is, however, no record
that they were issued by authority. Charles I. is said to
have granted in 1643 medals to soldiers who distinguished
themselves in forlorn hopes; and the numerous badges
issued during the Civil War by the King, and the Royalist
and the Parliamentary generals were undoubtedly intended
as military rewards and distributed among the soldiers
who fought under them. No. <a href="#M106">106</a>, which was issued by
Fairfax after the battle of Naseby, could only have served
for such a purpose. During the Commonwealth the
practice of bestowing decorative medals, both military and
naval, became more frequent, and on several occasions was
ordered by the Parliament. Of such medals is that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
distributed to all engaged at the battle of Dunbar (Nos.
<a href="#M149">149</a>—150), and also those for Blake's victories over the
Dutch, as well as several others.</p>

<p>Occasionally during the reigns of Charles II. and James
II. military rewards were issued; but as none of these
have rings for suspension, they cannot be considered as
decorative medals. After the Commonwealth the medal
for Culloden seems to be the first decorative piece: but
even of this medal there is no record of its having been
distributed by authority. Of that battle there is also a
circular medal with loop in copper, the type being the
Duke of Cumberland on horseback, which might also have
served for distribution.</p>

<p>Again a long period elapses during which no decorative
medals appear; and the victories of the Nile and Trafalgar
would have remained unrewarded, but for the munificence
and patriotism of two Englishmen, Alexander Davison
and Matthew Boulton (see Nos. <a href="#M539">539</a> and <a href="#M544">544</a>). In 1784
the East India Company acknowledged the services of its
troops by awarding a medal for the campaign in the West
of India, an example which originated a custom; and from
that time, as long as India remained under the control of
the Company, medals were awarded for all subsequent
wars. The first medal issued by authority in England in
this century is that given for the battle of Waterloo. It
was conferred by order of the Prince Regent upon every
officer and private present at that battle; but no acknowledgment
was made of all the brilliant engagements in
the Peninsular War till 1847, when a medal was issued for
military services between the years 1793—1814 (No. <a href="#M592">592</a>).
At the same time a corresponding medal for naval services
was ordered to be struck for all naval engagements during
the same period.</p>

<p>Since the accession of her Majesty medals have been
awarded for every campaign, as well as others for 'meritorious
service,' 'long service,' &amp;c. Besides the medals
issued by the authority of the Crown and those of the
East India Company, there are a number of Regimental
medals, of which some are exhibited. These were struck
at the expense of the officers of the regiments for distribution
among those who served under them; but this
custom ceased when a public acknowledgment was paid
to the services of the army.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span></p>

<p>The medals issued by the East India Company, being
mostly of Indian work, have been classed separately, and
will be found at the end of the series. As they were
generally awarded only to Native troops, they are for the
most part very scarce.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Method of
Production.</span></div>

<p>Before proceeding to give some account of the medallists<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
themselves, it may be useful to state shortly in what
manner they accomplished their work. This was done in
four different ways, by casting, by the repouss&eacute; process,
by engraving, and by striking. Specimens of all kinds of
work will be found in this exhibition.</p>

<p>In the case of casting, a method which was first adopted
in Italy in the fourteenth century, the mode was sometimes
elaborate. A model having been made in wax, it
was painted over several times with layers of cement
made of fine earth or charcoal stiffened with some kind of
lye, until this dried and hardened upon the wax, and the
foundation of a mould was formed. When the mould was
finished and completely hardened, the wax was melted
out, and the medal was then cast in some hard metal,
gold, silver, or copper, or in lead. By this process the first
mould was destroyed, and all subsequent ones had to be
taken from the medals themselves; consequently in time,
with each fresh casting, they became less sharp and
perfect. Another method of casting was, after executing
a model in wax, to make moulds from it in sand, in which
the medal was then cast. By this means the original
mould was not destroyed, and would serve for use any
number of times. But these casts were not so successful
as those made after the Italian method; and in order to
remove from the surface the roughness of the casting, the
medals were then submitted to the medallist's or goldsmith's
hands to be chased. In this manner a smooth and
sharp surface was obtained; but the chasing required to
be very skilfully done. The castings in lead on account
of the softness of the material took a much more even
surface than in the case of the harder metals, and rarely
required any after-chasing.</p>

<p>The process of repouss&eacute; work in its first stage was
somewhat similar to casting. A model was made in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
wax, from which a mould in a hard metal was cast, and
on this hard mould was placed a thin silver or copper
plate, which was then beaten into the mould with a
hammer till it received its final form. This process was
a long and difficult one, and required much skill; consequently
the number of repouss&eacute; medals is very small
as compared with those which were cast. Repouss&eacute; work
had one great advantage, that of obtaining a high
relief, and on good medals, a striking effect. Not unfrequently,
especially in Germany, the mould was made
of wood, and the plate then hammered into it; but this
method was not so satisfactory, as the degree of sharpness
was much lessened.</p>

<p>The process of engraving was more simple; but perhaps
not less difficult. The medals were executed by direct
incision with the graver or dry point on a plate of silver
or steel, and thus every line told, and the excellence of
the work depended upon the accuracy and sharpness of
the outline.</p>

<p>In the case of struck medals, the die was engraved or
cut in steel, which was hardened, and from which proofs
were struck in gold, silver, copper, &amp;c. This process
was not at first successful, as the mode of striking was
simply by the hammer, by which means sufficient force
could not be obtained. This was, however, obviated by
the invention of the screw, which was first adopted in the
sixteenth century, but did not entirely supersede the use
of the hammer until the middle of the seventeenth century.
Medals are now as a rule produced by striking.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Medallic
Art.</span></div>

<p>Of the medallists who worked during the reign of
Henry VIII. we know nothing, and none of the medals
bear the artists' signatures. The process employed was
that of casting; but this was often done with little skill,
and in consequence all the medals are highly chased.
The medals of the reign of Edward VI. show no improvement
in the art; but those of Mary and Philip, which are
exhibited, being executed by the Italian artist Trezzo,
are of far superior work. It is scarcely fair to class these
among English medals, as they were executed in Madrid
under the orders of Philip II., in whose service Trezzo
was retained during the greater part of his life. That
the works of this artist were much esteemed in his own
time we learn from Vasari, who says, 'This master has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
no equal for portraits from life, and is an artist of the
highest merit in other respects.' During the reign of
Elizabeth, a great improvement is manifest in medallic
art, which may be seen in the medals commemorating the
defeat of the Spanish Armada, all of which, so far as it
is known, were produced by native artists. There are
other fine medals of this reign; but these are the work
of foreign artists. Of such is the remarkable one with
the portrait of Mary Queen of Scots by Primavera, and
also a number of Dutch medals, among which are the
splendid life-like portraits by Stephen of Holland. These
medals are all cast and afterwards chased, and are
certainly very fine examples of Dutch art. It is not improbable
that this artist first studied at Nuremberg, which
was the great school for medallists in Germany, and in
which Albert D&uuml;rer himself had worked.</p>

<p>The medals of James I. are for the most part of Dutch
work; and as few are signed, we are unable to ascertain
by whom the majority were executed. As at this period the
new invention of the screw for striking coins and medals
was coming into general use, there are in consequence a
number of struck medals. The engraved portraits of the
royal family and others, classed at the end of the series of
James I., are by Simon Passe. This artist worked chiefly
with the graver in a neat clear style, which possesses
much originality. His works have great merit in their
class, especially his portraits, many of which were taken
from life, and are remarkable for their precision and
sharpness of outline. Besides these medals Passe executed
frontispieces and bookplates, which are also well engraved.
The abundant medals of the reign of Charles I. and of the
Commonwealth were chiefly produced by three artists,
Thomas Simon, his brother Abraham, and Thomas Rawlins.
We must add to these the works of Nicholas Briot, who
by his new invention of the balance for striking coins and
medals had rendered great service to medallic art. His
medals as well as his coins are all remarkable for their
clearness of design and sharpness of execution. Briot
did not reside in England after 1633, so that all his works
date from the early part of Charles's reign. There are
also a few medals by Jean Varin or Warin, who with
George Dupr&eacute; ranks first among French medallists. His
medals are always cast, and generally in high relief. Of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
the two Simons it may be truly said that they stand first
as English medallists, the beauty of their work having
never been equalled in this country. As portraits the
personal medals are faithful and expressive. The brothers
produced joint as well as separate medals: in the case of
a joint work Abraham appears to have made the model,
whilst Thomas, who was a more skilful engraver, did the
after-chasing. From an example in the British Museum,
it is evident that the Simons first made their models in
wax, and from these or from moulds in sand then cast
their medals. The work of Thomas Simon was not confined
to medals, for he executed all the Seals for the Commonwealth
and for Charles II., as well as a fine set of coins
which bear the portrait of the Protector. His last work
of this kind, the Petition Crown of Charles II., has never
been equalled in technical delicacy of execution, and is
certainly the finest coin of modern times. Thomas Rawlins
cannot be mentioned in such high terms as the Simons.
His work was far above the average; but it failed to attain
the sharpness and high finish which characterise that of
his two rivals. Some of his coins are perhaps superior
to his medals. Mention may be made here of the work
of two other artists, specimens of whose medals will be
found exhibited among those of Charles II. These are
Pieter van Abeele and M&uuml;ller, whom Bolzenthal calls
'der Meister M&uuml;ller,' two Dutch medallists who worked
in the repouss&eacute; style before and during the reign of
Charles II. The medals of these artists are in high relief,
and are executed with marked skill. Some of them are
chased.</p>

<p>At the Restoration Rawlins was reinstated in the place
of Chief Engraver to the Mint which he had held before
the Commonwealth; and as his attention appears to have
been chiefly directed to the coinage, there are very few
medals by him after this time. It was not so with
Thomas Simon, who was specially engaged to prepare dies
for the new Seals, for he continued to work at his medals
and produced a large number, including several for the
coronation. There are some medals (Nos. <a href="#M182">182</a>—183),
executed by him in anticipation of the Restoration,
which were probably made with the object of retaining
through the merit of his work the post of Chief Engraver,
to which he had been appointed by Cromwell.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
In this he did not succeed, but was transferred from the
Mint to the Office of Seals. Abraham Simon also continued
to work for some time after the Restoration; but
he held no official post. In the meanwhile a new set of
artists had sprung up in England, who with few exceptions
monopolised the medallic work in this country during the
reign of Charles II. These are the Roettiers, who had
been introduced to Charles during his stay in Holland,
and of whom there were three brothers, John, Joseph, and
Philip. It is of the eldest brother, John, that we have the
most numerous and finest works. The character of the
medals of this period differs very much from those of the
Commonwealth. They are always struck, as the new
invention of Briot had now quite superseded the hammer,
and are in low relief. The execution of the work is good,
the medals being very sharply cut and the portraits full
of expression, whilst the reverses have a more picturesque
style, somewhat approaching that of the Italian medals of
the sixteenth century, but in lower relief. The only other
medallist of this period who calls for notice is George
Bower or Bowers, the style of whose work is similar to
that of the Roettiers, although not of such good execution
and finish. John Roettier and Bower still continued
to work during the reign of James II., and during a
portion of that of William and Mary; but with the
accession of William, the Dutch period of medallic art
in England began and continued till the death of Anne.
The artists of this time are very numerous, but only
the chief ones need be here enumerated, who are Jan and
Martin Smeltzing, brothers, Jan Luder, Jan Boskam,
Georg Hautsch, and Jan Crocker or Croker. This last
artist not only executed a large series of medals, but he
also cut all the dies for the coinage of Anne as well as
many of that of George I. and George II. The style of
the medals of the Dutch period is somewhat similar to that
of the Roettiers, the relief being still lower. The reverse
designs are also often picturesque, and, although minute
in design, are usually distinct and in good perspective.</p>

<p>The accession of the House of Hanover introduced into
England some German artists; but few of them are of
any note. Of the medallists who worked in England from
the accession of George I. to the end of the last century,
are J. A. Dassier, who executed the large series of medals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>
of English Sovereigns from William I. to George II.;
Richard Yeo, who made the Culloden medal; Thomas
Pingo, who made the Gibraltar medal of 1782, and several
medals for societies; C. H. K&uuml;chler, who executed the
Nile and Trafalgar medals; and J. G. Hancock, whose
works are very numerous.</p>

<p>Medallic art of the present century in England owes
all its merit to the work of Pistrucci, an Italian who
came to this country in 1815 and remained here till his
death in 1855, and to the work of the Wyon Family. To
Pistrucci we are indebted for the famous Waterloo Medal,
for many medals of learned societies, and for some of our
finest coin-dies; and to the Wyons, for the military and
naval medals as well as for a most extensive series of
academical and other pieces. Since the resignation by
Pistrucci of the office of Engraver to the Mint, the Wyons
have held that post and have produced the greater portion
of the dies for coins.</p>

<p>In concluding this sketch of medallic art in England,
some mention should be made of the efforts of several
public-spirited firms, which at the beginning of the present
century produced series of medals commemorating
some of the great events of English history at that time.
The most important of these is the series of National
Medals of James Mudie, on which work a number of
foreign as well as native artists were employed; and
it is remarkable that these engravers include eminent
French medallists who commemorated the English
successes in the wars with France.</p>

<p>This medal presents us with a remarkable portrait of
Mary Queen of Scots, and is the work of Giacomo
Primavera. Its date is uncertain, but judging from other
existing portraits of Mary, it was probably executed about
the same time as the Morton portrait, which was painted
by order of Mary during her imprisonment in Lochleven
Castle, 1566—67. There are modern casts of this medal, to
which a reverse has been added. (See guide to Italian

presented to Blake and Monk; two with chains of &pound;100
value each, to Admirals Penn and Lawson. Of these medals
three are extant. In 1651, when Scotland was incorporated
with the Commonwealth, a third shield was
introduced, in the arms of Great Britain. The shield of
Scotland is not on the naval reward of 1650. (See No.

<p>This and the next medal are without date. They

generally supposed that they were struck at the conclusion
of the treaty of Breda, 31st July, 1667; but that is not
possible, for Pepys in his diary under date 26th Feb. 1667,
in speaking of this medal, says: "At my goldsmith's did
observe the King's new medal where in little there is
Mrs. Stewart's face as well done as ever I saw any thing
in my whole life, I think: and a pretty thing it is that
he should choose her face to represent Brittannia by."
Mrs. Stuart, afterwards Duchess of Richmond, was one of

<p>Like St. Denis, who after his martyrdom picked up his

walking after his murder, because it was asserted by some

<p>Great uncertainty exists in the identification of the

represent Titus Oates and Bedloe, and the cluster the

<p>It was rumoured in Holland that a secret treaty had
been concluded between James and Louis XIV. called
"The French league to cut Protestants' throats in
England," and also that James had allowed some Algerine
Corsairs to carry Dutch prizes into English ports. Like-wise
Louis was accused of exciting the Turks against
the Germans. As illustrating these rumours these four
potentates are represented as leaguing together against
Christianity, the devil being a fifth conspirator.

they were, but the horseman, being an old servant of the
King, at once recognised his master. Great rejoicings and

<p>The battle of Talavera, 27 July, 1809, was the first of
the great victories of Wellington in the Peninsula. The
French were commanded by Joseph Bonaparte, Victor and
Sebastiani, and the Allies by Wellington and Cuesta. For
this victory Wellington, then Sir Arthur Wellesley, was
raised to the peerage. This is one of the series of National
Medals issued under the direction of James Mudie in 1820,
"to commemorate the succession of victories achieved by
British arms over Napoleon." A number of English and
foreign artists were employed in the accomplishment of
this work.</p>

<p>This medal was executed in pursuance of an order given
by the Prince Regent in 1819, who desired to commemorate
the battle of Waterloo by the production of a
medal of surpassing magnitude and beauty. It was
intended for presentation to each of the allied sovereigns
as well as to the two commanders, Wellington and
Blucher; but this object failed, as Pistrucci, who was
directed to execute the work, did not accomplish the task
till 1st January, 1849, and Wellington then alone survived.
This medal has not been issued, as the dies have never
been hardened; but it has been reproduced by the electro

<p>Great disappointment having been expressed that no
medal had been awarded either to the army or navy for
the numerous victories achieved between 1793—1814, the
Queen, 1st June, 1847, ordered that a medal should be
struck and bestowed upon any surviving officer or private
present at any battle or siege between those dates. For
this purpose, the above medal was struck. It carries 28
clasps, and the earliest military service thus decorated is
the campaign in Egypt 1801, which was, however, not
included in the general order, but was afterwards granted
under an order 12 Feb. 1850. A similar order was issued
regarding naval services, commencing with the capture of
the French frigate "Cleopatra," 18 June, 1793, and for
which a separate medal was struck, having on the reverse,

Giacomo da Trezzo, sculptor, engraver and medallist, born at Milan at the
beginning of the sixteenth century, first worked in the execution of medals
for the Gonzaga family. He afterwards entered the service of Phillip II. of
Spain, went to Madrid and was engaged in the decoration of the Escurial.
He died at Madrid in 1589.</p></div>

Very little is known of Giacomo Primavera beyond what information
is supplied by his medals. He was of Italian origin, perhaps Milanese, and
was born before the middle of the sixteenth century. He appears to have
worked chiefly in France and the Netherlands, as nearly all his medals bear
portraits of personages of those two countries. The above medal was
probably executed from a portrait, as it does not appear he was ever in
Scotland. He died about the beginning of the 17th century.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">4</a>
Stephen of Holland, like Primavera, is only known by his medals. From
these we gather that he worked at first in Holland, executing many
medallic portraits of his countrymen. He was also in the employ of
Sigismund, King of Poland. He resided for a short period in England, where
he produced a large number of portrait-medals of private persons. These
are for the most part dated 1562.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">5</a>
Jean Warm or Varin, born at Liege 1604, studied at a very early age
painting, especially portraiture, and the art of engraving, placing himself
under the direction of the French medallist Dupr&eacute;. His talents attracting
the notice of Cardinal de Richelieu, he was appointed engraver to the royal
mint at Paris. This appointment Varin held till his death, adding at a
later period those of Superintendent-General of the Coinage, and Guardian
of the Dies. Varin visited England and Sweden, receiving many commissions
in both countries. In painting he has left little of note; but of
medals some of the finest productions of the seventeenth century were
executed by him. He died in 1672.</p></div>

Simon Passe, the youngest son of Crispin Passe, the eminent artist of
Utrecht, born circ. <small>A.D.</small> 1574, received his first instruction in the art of
engraving from his father. About 1613 he came to England, where he
resided for some 10 years, and engraved a large number of prints, portraits,
&amp;c. He was employed by Nicholas Hillard to engrave counters of the
Royal Family of England. After quitting England, he entered the service
of the King of Denmark, under whose protection he remained till his death
circ. 1644.</p></div>

Nicholas Briot, the chief engraver to the Paris mint during the reign of
Louis XIII., was the inventor of the balance for striking coins. Before his
invention all coins were struck by the hammer. Briot first submitted his
new invention to the authorities at Paris in 1615; but it was not adopted
till 1623, and then only temporarily, when he was placed at the head of
the coinage in France for that year. The opposition experienced by Briot
in his own country induced him to submit his invention to the authorities
at the London Mint, where it was at once favourably received, and he was
appointed chief engraver from 1628—1633, when he returned to France and
again received employment at the Paris Mint. During his residence in
England Briot executed a large number of dies for coins as well as dies and
moulds for medals, all of which are gems of medallic work.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">8</a>
The date of Thomas Rawlins's first engagement at the Mint is
uncertain. We find him, however, associated with Briot as engraver
before 1642. Upon the breaking out of the Civil War, Rawlins attached
himself to the person of the King, for whom he executed many of the dies
used at the local mints. Amongst these the most remarkable is that of
the Oxford crown. After the death of Charles, Rawlins executed several
commemorative medals, which were distributed amongst those who were
true to the royal cause. He was also employed by the corporations of
certain provincial towns, of which were Oxford, Bristol, and Gloucester, in
the manufacture of tokens. After the Restoration, Simon being removed
from his post at the mint, and being appointed "one of His Majesty's
Chief Engravers," &amp;c., Rawlins was reinstated with the title of "Chief
Engraver." This situation he filled till his death, which occurred in 1670,
at which time he was engaged on new dies for a sovereign.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">9</a>
Thomas Simon, the artist, whose birthplace and date of birth are
uncertain, was first noticed by Nicholas Briot about 1633, and through
him was engaged at the Royal Mint in 1636, to engrave the great seal of
the Admiralty. In 1645 Simon received his first appointment under
Parliament as "Joint Chief Engraver" with Edward Wade, and producing
several seals of State remarkable for their artistic skill, he was rewarded
by promotion to the post of "Chief Engraver to the Mint and Seals."
From this time till the Restoration, Simon produced a large number of
medals, many of which are of great beauty both in design and execution,
and also the coins with the effigy of the Protector, by whom he was
appointed "Sole Chief Engraver and Medal-maker." At the Restoration
a fresh patent having been granted to Simon as one of His Majesty's Chief
Engravers, he was ordered to prepare the necessary Great Seals, those of
the Protector having been broken up. The appointment of John Roettier
as one of the Engravers to the Mint led to a quarrel between him and
Simon, which resulted in the resignation of the latter. Simon died in
1665 of the plague. Some little time before his death, he produced his
masterpiece "The Petition Crown."</p></div>

Of Abraham Simon, the brother of Thomas Simon, our information is
very limited. At an early age he studied theology, but with tastes
similar to those of his brother, he soon left these studies and went to
Sweden, where his reputation as a modeller in wax speedily raised him to
public notice. He entered the service of Queen Christina, and became one
of her suite in her travels. Before the outbreak of the Civil War he
returned to England, where his portraits became famous. That he left
England during the Commonwealth, as stated by some, is very doubtful, as
there are many medals executed by him during that period, and chiefly of
leading parliamentarians. It is certain, that at the Restoration he stood
high in favour with the King, and received 100 guineas for a portrait of
him in wax. In disgust at the treatment he received from the Duke of
York, he ceased to work altogether, and died shortly afterwards in great
poverty.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">11</a>
Jerian Pool or Juriaen van Pool was a medallist of some note at
Amsterdam, whose works date from the middle to the second half of the
17th century. The most important of his medals are a portrait of
Admiral Martin van Tromp, 1653, another of William, Prince of Orange,
of the following year, and the inauguration-medal of the Guildhall of
Amsterdam, 1655.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">12</a>
Pieter van Abeele lived at Amsterdam, and was probably a pupil of
Jerian Pool. Van Abeele's most famous work is a medal in commemoration
of the granting of arms to the city of Amsterdam in 1342 and 1488.
He also executed medals for William II. and III. of Orange, Gustavus
Adolphus, &amp;c. His medals are of repouss&eacute; work and chased, the two sides
being united by a rim.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">13</a>
The head of the Roettier family "the family of Medallists" was one
John Roettier a native of Antwerp and a goldsmith by profession, who
had three sons, John, Joseph, and Philip. During the residence of Charles
II. in Holland, John the eldest brother was presented to him as an eminent
medallist, and upon his coming to England soon after the Restoration he
was appointed one of the engravers to the Mint having Thomas Simon as
his colleague, who retired from his post in 1664. John Roettier then
became one of the Chief Engravers to the Mint, and with him was associated
his brother Joseph, and somewhat later his younger brother Philip,
as in 1669 we find that by letters patent July 3rd, 1669, John, Joseph, and
Philip Roettier were appointed His Majesty's Engravers at the Mint with a
yearly allowance of &pound;450 during their natural lives. In 1672, through
the death of Varin, Joseph Roettier by Colbert's influence, obtained the
appointment of Chief Engraver at the Mint at Paris, and in 1678 Philip
Roettier quitted England and went to reside in Flanders, the coinage of that
country during that period showing many traces of his work, which is
inferior in style to that of his elder brothers. In 1690 upon the death of
G. Bower, James, the eldest son of John Roettier, was associated with his
father at the Mint; but in 1694 having played tricks with a portrait of
William III., which he was executing for a new copper coinage, he was
dismissed, and going to France found employment at the Paris Mint.
Norbert his brother, who does not appear to have been regularly employed
at the London Mint, having abstracted some of the dies for fraudulent
purposes, fled in the following year also to France, and like his brother
obtained an appointment at the Paris Mint. He also executed a large
number of medals for the Stuart family (v. Stuart Medals, p. 60). The
inquiry which followed this scandal resulted in the dismissal of John
Roettier, who died in 1703, and was buried in the Tower.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">14</a>
George Bower, or Bowers, as he signs himself on his later medals,
was appointed one of the engravers to the Mint after the Restoration, a
post which he filled till his death in 1690. He executed a large number
of medals for the Royal Family, and also for private individuals, which
are characterized by skill and execution.</p></div>

Christoffel Adolfszoon, a Dutch medallist who worked during the
second half of the 17th century, is best known by a medal, which he
executed of Michael de Ruyter. His work is coarse, but characteristic of
Dutch medallic art of that period.</p></div>

M&uuml;ller, whom Bolzenthal calls "der Meister M&uuml;ller," worked in

repouss&eacute; work of the same style as Pieter van Abeele.</p></div>

Jan Smeltzing, born at Nimeguen, worked principally at Leyden, where
he incurred such blame by his satirical medals that he was compelled to
seek refuge for a while in France. He was, however, allowed to return to
Leyden, where he died at the end of the 17th century. Smeltzing worked
for the Emperor Leopold I., Louis XIV. of France, and James II. and
William III. of England, besides others. His medals were much
esteemed.</p></div>

The place occupied in medallic art in the 17th century by the
Roettier family has been filled during the present century by the family
of the Wyons. This family is of German origin, George Wyon, the first
member who visited England, being a native of Cologne, and forming one
of the suite of George I., to whose person he was attached as Chief Goldsmith.
He is said to have died in the West Indies. His son George was
apprenticed to Hemmings, the goldsmith of George II., and in 1772 executed
for the City of London a silver cup which was presented to John Wilkes,
the "Patriot." In 1775 he was engaged at the Soho mint near Birmingham,
and died in 1796, leaving four sons, the two eldest being Thomas and
Peter, who acted together as a firm of general die-engravers in Birmingham
till 1800. In this year Thomas came to London, and was employed in the
Dept. of the Engraver of His Majesty's Seals, and of which Dept. he
became chief in 1816. He died in 1830, surviving by many years his son,
Thomas Wyon, jun., who at the early age of 23 in 1815 was appointed
Chief Engraver to the Mint, and who in that capacity executed, among
numerous medals, that for the battle of Waterloo (No. <a href="#M576">576</a>) and also the
great recoinage of 1816. T. Wyon, jun., died in 1817. His brother
Benjamin was appointed Chief Engraver of His Majesty's Seals in 1831,
and executed among other works the Crimea medal (No. <a href="#M597">597</a>). He died
in 1858, and was succeeded in his appointment by his son, J. S. Wyon,
who in conjunction with his brother, A. B. Wyon, engraved the New
Zealand (No. <a href="#M603">603</a>) and Abyssinian (No. <a href="#M605">605</a>) medals. J. S. Wyon died in
1873, and the appointment which he held was given to his brother,
A. B. Wyon. Peter Wyon, the second son of George Wyon, after the
departure of his brother to London remained at Birmingham, where he
displayed great taste in his designs and models for ornamental brass-work.
Before his death he had the satisfaction of seeing his son William
enjoying greater reputation than himself. William Wyon, the R.A., was
born at Birmingham 1795, and in 1815 he came to London. In the following
year he was appointed Assistant Engraver to the Mint, and in 1828
succeeded Pistrucci as Chief Engraver. In 1832 he was elected an Associate
of the Royal Academy, and in 1838 Academician, this being the first
instance of a medallist receiving such distinction. Besides the numerous
coinages which W. Wyon executed, he produced a large series of
military, academical, and private medals. He died in 1851, and was succeeded
in his post by his son, L. C. Wyon, the present Engraver to the
Mint, who, besides engraving a large series of national, colonial, and foreign
coinages, has executed the medals for the Second Burmese War (No. <a href="#M595">595</a>),
for Campaigns in South Africa (No. <a href="#M596">596</a>), for Service in the Baltic
(No. <a href="#M598">598</a>), for the Indian Mutiny (No. <a href="#M601">601</a>), for Arctic Discoveries
(No. <a href="#M602">602</a>), for the Ashantee War (No. <a href="#M606">606</a>), &amp;c.</p></div>

Benedetto Pistrucci, born at Rome 1784 of good family, his father
being Judge of the High Criminal Court at Rome, began at the early age
of twelve to study the art of gem and cameo cutting, and acquired such
proficiency that before he was sixteen his works were often disposed of by
dealers as antiques. In 1815 Pistrucci came to England, and two years
later, upon the death of T. Wyon, was appointed Chief Engraver to the
Mint, being immediately engaged on the new silver and gold coinage,
having for the reverse type the St. George and Dragon. For some time
after the accession of George IV., Pistrucci was engaged on a coinage for
the new reign, which, having finished, he was promoted in 1828 to the
post of Chief Medallist to the Mint, W. Wyon being appointed his successor
as Chief Engraver. From this period till 1849 Pistrucci was
engaged on the dies of the Waterloo medal, occasionally relieving the
monotony of the work by the production of a large number of gems
and medals, among the latter being the Coronation Medal of Victoria,
a medal of the Duke of Wellington, one for the Royal Humane Society,
&amp;c. &amp;c. He died in 1855.</p></div>
